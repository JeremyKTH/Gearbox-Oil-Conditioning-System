<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## Introduction
This master thesis contains two research questions:

RQ1: Is about the investigation of system identification of a Gearbox Oil Conditioning System.

RQ2: Is about the further controller implementation using pole placement methods via TwinCAT3.

5 different linear system identification models were used: ARX, ARMAX, BJ, TF, SS.

## JupyterLab_Folder
The purpose for the folder is for data pre-processing. Namely, reorder and extract the useful data information from the original recorded data from the testbed. There are three processed dataset: (SI_47414, SI_48414, SI_49404), which represents the different valve operating range. In each dataset, it is then further splitted into training and testing dataset with size ratio 1:1.
* Data Pre-process
* SI_47414 (operating range $\pm$ 30%)
* SI_48404
* SI_49404
