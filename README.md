<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## Introduction
This master thesis contains two sections, the first section is the investigation of system identification of a Gearbox Oil Conditioning System.

It contains 6 different linear approximation models such as transfer funcction, state space, ARX, ARMAX. BJ. The second section is the design and implementation of a PI controller with pole-placement method.


### Data Pre-process
This code is for data pre-processing the original raw data

### SI_1
This code is for system identification

### SI_2
This code is for pole placement, in Jupyter Lab and MatLab form

### try_reduce_order
This code is for using the balred() function to reduce model order
